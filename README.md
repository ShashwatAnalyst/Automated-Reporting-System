# Data Warehouse & Report Automation Project

This project showcases a fully **automated data warehouse and analytics workflow**. The warehouse is built with **SQL**, while **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn** are used for reporting and visualizations. The entire **ETL process is executed in one click via batch file processing**, generating CSV reports and updated PDF of notebook. It demonstrates practical **data engineering, automation, and analytics skills** in a hands-on portfolio project.

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

This project implements a Medallion Architecture with three layers: **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold**.<br><br>

## 🔗 Integration Model Diagram

This diagram illustrates how data from CRM and ERP sources is integrated at the logical level. It shows the relationships between transactional, customer, and product tables across both systems, highlighting how disparate data sources are connected and unified for downstream processing.

![Integration Model](docs/integration_model_diagram.png)

- **Bronze Layer**: Captures raw data directly from source systems (CSV files) into a SQL Server database.
- **Silver Layer**: Focuses on cleaning, standardizing, and transforming data to prepare it for analytics.
- **Gold Layer**: Contains business-ready, analytics-optimized data modeled in a star schema.

## 🔄 Automated Data Flow Diagram

This diagram summarizes the journey of data from CRM and ERP sources through the Bronze and Silver layers, where it is refined and integrated. The process culminates in the Gold layer, producing analytical tables ready for business intelligence and reporting.  

**New Feature:** The entire ETL process is **automated** via a batch file, so all layers and reporting outputs are refreshed with a single execution.

## ⭐ Star Schema Model Diagram

The star schema diagram represents the final analytical data model in the Gold layer. It demonstrates how fact and dimension tables are structured for efficient querying and reporting, with clear relationships between sales transactions, customers, and products.<br><br>

## 🚀 How to Run the Full Automated ETL Pipeline

After building and testing the automation scripts for all three layers ([Bronze](./scripts/01_bronze/), [Silver](./scripts/02_silver/), and [Gold](./scripts/03_gold/)), you can now run the **entire ETL process and reporting system in one click** using the `run_full_etl.bat` file.  

**Sample Output:**

```bat
========================================================
 Starting Full ETL Process...
========================================================

[1/3]  Loading Bronze Layer...
TRUNCATE TABLE
COPY ...
Load completed successfully.

[2/3] Loading Silver Layer...
INSERT ...
Silver Layer Transformation Completed Successfully.

[3/3] Loading Gold Layer...
CREATE VIEW ...
Gold Layer views created successfully.

[4/4] Generating Reports...
Customer_Report.csv generated successfully.
Product_Report.csv generated successfully.
Notebook_Report.ipynb updated successfully.

========================================================
 Full ETL & Reporting Process Completed Successfully
 Total Time Taken: 35 seconds
========================================================
Press any key to continue . . .
```
With this, your data warehouse and analytics reports are fully refreshed and ready for stakeholders. ✅

## 📄 Reports

After running the ETL pipeline, the project automatically generates the following reports:

- **Customer_Report.csv** – Customer analytics and metrics  
- **Product_Report.csv** – Product performance insights  
- **Analytics_&_Report.ipynb** – Complete visual report with charts and tables  
- **report.pdf** - Clean PDF version of **Analytics_&_Report.ipynb** notebook file

You can also access the **final report as a PDF** here: [Final Report Notebook PDF](./automated_reports/report.pdf)

## 🚦 Project Requirements

### Data Engineering

**Goal:**
Build a modern data warehouse that consolidates sales data for analytics and reporting.

**Scope:**
- **Data Sources:** Import data from ERP and CRM systems (CSV format).
- **Data Quality:** Clean and resolve issues before analysis.
- **Integration:** Merge both sources into a unified, analysis-friendly model.
- **Focus:** Use only the latest data; historization is not required.
- **Documentation:** Provide clear data model documentation for business and analytics users.

---

### 📈 Analytics & Reporting

**Goal:**  
Develop automated analytics and visual reports using **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn** to deliver actionable insights on:  
- Customer behavior and segmentation  
- Product performance and trends  
- Sales patterns and time-based analysis  

**Automation:**  
Reports are generated automatically as **CSV files** and **notebooks with visualizations**, enabling easy review and decision-making.
